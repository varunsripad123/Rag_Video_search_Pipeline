# ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy Improvement Guide

Techniques to boost search accuracy from 30% to 60-80%.

---

## ðŸ“Š Current Performance

**Baseline (CLIP only):**
- Relevant queries: 30-32%
- Random queries: 20-22%
- Discrimination: 10-12%

**Target:**
- Relevant queries: 60-80%
- Random queries: 10-20%
- Discrimination: 40-60%

## ðŸš€ Improvement Techniques

### 1. **Temporal Aggregation** (Expected: +10-15%)

**Problem:** Single frame doesn't capture motion
**Solution:** Aggregate multiple frames with attention

```python
# Instead of averaging, use weighted aggregation
# Early frames + middle frames + late frames
weights = [0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2]  # Focus on middle
video_embedding = sum(w * frame_emb for w, frame_emb in zip(weights, frame_embeddings))
```

**Expected improvement:** 30% â†’ 40-45%

---

### 2. **Multi-Scale Features** (Expected: +5-10%)

**Problem:** CLIP only uses 224x224 resolution
**Solution:** Process at multiple scales

```python
# Process at 224x224, 336x336, 448x448
scales = [224, 336, 448]
multi_scale_embeddings = []
for scale in scales:
    resized = resize(frame, (scale, scale))
    emb = clip.encode(resized)
    multi_scale_embeddings.append(emb)

# Concatenate or average
final_embedding = np.concatenate(multi_scale_embeddings)
```

**Expected improvement:** 40% â†’ 45-50%

---

### 3. **Query Expansion** (Expected: +10-15%)

**Problem:** Single query might not capture intent
**Solution:** Expand query with synonyms

```python
# Expand "basketball" to multiple queries
expanded_queries = [
    "basketball",
    "person playing basketball",
    "basketball game",
    "basketball court",
    "shooting basketball"
]

# Average embeddings
query_embeddings = [clip.encode_text(q) for q in expanded_queries]
final_query = np.mean(query_embeddings, axis=0)
```

**Expected improvement:** 45% â†’ 55-60%

---

### 4. **Fine-tuning on UCF101** (Expected: +15-20%)

**Problem:** CLIP trained on general images, not actions
**Solution:** Fine-tune on your dataset

```python
# Fine-tune CLIP on UCF101
# Use contrastive learning with video-text pairs
for video, label in ucf101_dataset:
    video_emb = model.encode_video(video)
    text_emb = model.encode_text(label)
    loss = contrastive_loss(video_emb, text_emb)
    loss.backward()
```

**Expected improvement:** 55% â†’ 70-75%

---

### 5. **Ensemble Models** (Expected: +5-10%)

**Problem:** Single model has biases
**Solution:** Combine multiple models

```python
# Use multiple models
models = [
    "openai/clip-vit-base-patch32",
    "openai/clip-vit-large-patch14",
    "laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K"
]

# Average predictions
embeddings = [model.encode(video) for model in models]
final_embedding = np.mean(embeddings, axis=0)
```

**Expected improvement:** 70% â†’ 75-80%

---

### 6. **Motion Features** (Expected: +5-10%)

**Problem:** CLIP doesn't capture motion well
**Solution:** Add optical flow features

```python
# Extract optical flow between frames
flow = compute_optical_flow(frame1, frame2)
flow_features = encode_flow(flow)

# Combine with CLIP
combined = np.concatenate([clip_features, flow_features])
```

**Expected improvement:** 75% â†’ 80-85%

---

### 7. **Semantic Filtering** (Expected: +5%)

**Problem:** FAISS returns all results, even bad ones
**Solution:** Filter by minimum similarity

```python
# Only return results above threshold
min_similarity = 0.25  # 25%
filtered_results = [r for r in results if r.score > min_similarity]
```

**Expected improvement:** Better precision, same recall

## ðŸ“ˆ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
1. âœ… Temporal aggregation with attention
2. âœ… Query expansion
3. âœ… Semantic filtering

**Expected: 30% â†’ 50-55%**

### Phase 2: Advanced (1 day)
4. âœ… Multi-scale features
5. âœ… Ensemble models

**Expected: 55% â†’ 65-70%**

### Phase 3: Expert (1 week)
6. âœ… Fine-tuning on UCF101
7. âœ… Motion features

**Expected: 70% â†’ 80-85%**

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach

**Start with Phase 1 (Quick Wins):**
- Easiest to implement
- Biggest impact per effort
- No training required

**Then Phase 2 if needed:**
- More complex but still manageable
- Good accuracy boost

**Phase 3 only if critical:**
- Requires ML expertise
- Time-consuming
- Diminishing returns

## ðŸ’¡ Which Techniques to Use?

### For Your Use Case (UCF101, 13K videos):

**Must Have:**
1. âœ… Temporal aggregation with attention
2. âœ… Query expansion
3. âœ… Semantic filtering

**Nice to Have:**
4. Multi-scale features (if GPU memory allows)
5. Ensemble models (if latency not critical)

**Skip:**
6. Fine-tuning (overkill for demo)
7. Motion features (complex, marginal gain)
