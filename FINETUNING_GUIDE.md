## 📊 Fine-tuning Strategies

### Strategy 1: **Lightweight Adapter** (Recommended)
**Best for:** Most clients, fast training, low cost

```python
# Add adapter layers to CLIP (LoRA)
# Only train 1-2% of parameters
# Training time: 2-4 hours
# Cost: $5-10
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fast training (2-4 hours)
- ✅ Low compute cost ($5-10)
- ✅ No overfitting risk
- ✅ Easy to update

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Moderate improvement (+15-25%)

---

### Strategy 2: **Full Fine-tuning**
**Best for:** Large datasets (10K+ videos), critical applications

```python
# Fine-tune entire CLIP model
# Train all parameters
# Training time: 1-2 days
# Cost: $50-100
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Maximum accuracy (+30-50%)
- ✅ Best for domain-specific content

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slow training (1-2 days)
- ❌ High compute cost ($50-100)
- ❌ Risk of overfitting
- ❌ Harder to update

---

### Strategy 3: **Hybrid Approach** (Best Balance)
**Best for:** Medium datasets (1K-10K videos)

```python
# Freeze CLIP vision encoder
# Fine-tune text encoder only
# Training time: 4-8 hours
# Cost: $10-20
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Good accuracy (+20-35%)
- ✅ Reasonable cost ($10-20)
- ✅ Balanced approach

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires some ML expertise

## 🔧 Implementation

### Step 1: Data Preparation

```python
# Prepare client videos with labels
dataset = {
    "video_path": "client_video_001.mp4",
    "labels": [
        "surgical procedure",
        "laparoscopic surgery",
        "medical operation"
    ],
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15"
}
```

### Step 2: Fine-tuning Script

```python
from transformers import CLIPModel, CLIPProcessor
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
import torch

class ClientCLIPFineTuner:
    def __init__(self, base_model="openai/clip-vit-base-patch32"):
        self.model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(base_model)
        self.processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(base_model)
        
        # Add LoRA adapters (lightweight fine-tuning)
        lora_config = LoraConfig(
            r=16,  # Rank
            lora_alpha=32,
            target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],
            lora_dropout=0.1
        )
        self.model = get_peft_model(self.model, lora_config)
        
    def train(self, client_videos, epochs=10):
        """Fine-tune on client videos."""
        optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(self.model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
        
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            for video, labels in client_videos:
                # Extract frames
                frames = self.extract_frames(video)
                
                # Get embeddings
                image_emb = self.model.get_image_features(frames)
                text_emb = self.model.get_text_features(labels)
                
                # Contrastive loss
                loss = self.contrastive_loss(image_emb, text_emb)
                
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
                optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        return self.model
```

```

**Improvement:** +50% accuracy

## 🔄 Continuous Learning Pipeline

```
Client Videos → Fine-tune → Deploy → Collect Feedback → Retrain
     ↑                                                      ↓
     └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Monthly Retraining
```python
# Automated retraining pipeline
def monthly_retrain():
    # Collect new videos from past month
    new_videos = get_new_videos(last_30_days)
    
    # Fine-tune on new data
    model = finetune(base_model, new_videos)
    
    # A/B test
    accuracy_new = test_accuracy(model, test_set)
    accuracy_old = test_accuracy(current_model, test_set)
    
    # Deploy if better
    if accuracy_new > accuracy_old:
        deploy(model)
```

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

### Option 1: On-Premise Fine-tuning
```python
# Client keeps all data
# Fine-tune on their infrastructure
# No data leaves their network
```

**Pros:** Maximum privacy
**Cons:** Client needs GPU infrastructure

### Option 2: Federated Learning
```python
# Train on client data without seeing it
# Only model updates are shared
# Privacy-preserving
```

**Pros:** Good privacy, no infrastructure needed
**Cons:** More complex implementation

### Option 3: Cloud Fine-tuning with Encryption
```python
# Encrypt videos before upload
# Fine-tune on encrypted data
# Decrypt results only
```

**Pros:** Balanced approach
**Cons:** Some privacy concerns
